# Mahjong: LLM-powered Multi-modal Native Data Lake

from zero to hero

## TODO
1. build dataframe, Pandas is a good start like [LOTUS](https://github.com/lotus-data/lotus).
2. build semantic operators by referencing [LOTUS](https://github.com/lotus-data/lotus) and [DocETL](https://github.com/ucbepic/docetl).


## Operators
The coding example of operators is as follow:

`Map`: perform a projecton on target data based on a predicate. (the execution refers to ops/map.py and used prompts refer to prompt_templates/map_prompter.py)
